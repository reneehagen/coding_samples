### Modeling the effect of a first birth on total labor income by gender, accounting for age and market effects

# This script analyses PSID income data to investigate the temporal effect of having a first child on parents' labor income.
# I use a Bayesian hierarchical model with a hurdle-lognormal link function, as labor income is exponentially distributed 
# but also includes zeroes. These zeroes are important, because parents (and especially mothers) may leave the labor market 
# when they have children. 
#
# The model accounts for the complex survey design of the PSID, as well as for attrition in two ways: 1) I weigh the likelihood
# contribution of each row in the data by the survey weights provided by the PSID, and 2) I use information on sampling strata
# and clusters within strata as varying intercepts
#
# Lastly, I am interested in the effect of having children after accounting for variation in income across the lifespan and 
# variation due to market-wide effects. Income increases with age but flattens after age ~50, so I account for this with polynomials.
# I account for market fluctuations with varying intercepts per year.
